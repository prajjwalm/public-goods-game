# Public Goods Game
## An interactive simualation

This web project is my effort in simulating the [public goods game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_goods_game). In the game players may choose to cooperate for the public good, or choose not to, which will result in much more (though temporary) gains.

When complete, I hope that this project will offer insight into human behaviour in matters of cooperation and trust. And how our personalities and society can lead to progress or stagnation (or decline).

## Stuff done so far
* Various automated players driven by different algorithms play for the society's (and their own) good.
* Multiple human driven players can also join in the game.
* The punishment variant of the game has been implemented.
