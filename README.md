# Public Goods Game
## An interactive simualation

This web project is my effort in simulating the [public goods game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_goods_game).

The project includes two main tasks, 
* Develop a website where multiple visitors can play the standard version of the game with each other.
* Study the outcome of different versions of the game with different populations (automated) and multiplicative factors.

When complete, I hope that this project will offer insight into human behaviour in matters of cooperation and trust. And how our personalities and society can lead to progress or stagnation (or decline).

### Stuff done so far
* A functional multiplayer version has been implemented.
* Various automated players driven by different algorithms have been developed in a prototype version.

### Stuff remaining 
* Improve the features, user interface and sturdiness of the multiplayer webpage.
* Make the bots learn to play better by making them compete with one another.
* Build the exploration version where the results of the study shall be presented.
